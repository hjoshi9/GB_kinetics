# Disconnection_energetics
Implementation of disconnection image creation algorithm outlined in the paper
"Energetics of the nucleation and glide of disconnection modes in symmetric tilt grain boundaries"
The method (described in detail in the paper) can be broken down in 5 steps.
Run grid_search.py to carry out Step 1.
data folder contains output from Step 2 (implemented in oILAB, available on github).
Run main.py to carry out Step 3, 4 and 5.
