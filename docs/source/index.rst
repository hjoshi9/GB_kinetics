Welcome to GB kinetics documentation!
====================================================
| This python project is the implementation of method developed in the paper:

| Joshi, Himanshu, Ian Chesser, Brandon Runnels, and Nikhil Chandra Admal. "Energetics of the nucleation and glide of disconnection modes in symmetric tilt grain boundaries." arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.16854 (2025).
| doi : https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.16854


| This method helps investigate the mechanisms involved with motion of a GB assuming that disconnection glide and migration is the underlying mechanism.
| The program creates atomistic systems showing nucleation and glide of a chosen disconnection mode and uses Nugded Elastic Band (NEB) method to calculate the Minimum Energy Path(MEP).
