Welcome to Disconnection energetics's documentation!
====================================================
| This python project is the implementation of method developed in the paper: 

**Energetics of the nucleation and glide of disconnection modes in symmetric tilt grain boundaries** (under review)

| This method helps investigate the mechanisms involved with motion of a GB assuming that disconnection glide and migration is the underlying mechanism.
| The program creates atomistic systems showing nucleation and glide of a chosen disconnection mode and uses Nugded Elastic Band (NEB) method to calculate the Minimum Energy Path(MEP).
