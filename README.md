# Disconnection_energetics
Implementation of disconnection image creation algorithm outlined in the paper.<br />
"Energetics of the nucleation and glide of disconnection modes in symmetric tilt grain boundaries" <br />
The method (described in detail in the paper) can be broken down in 5 steps.<br />
Run grid_search.py to carry out Step 1.<br />
data folder contains output from Step 2 (implemented in oILAB, available on github).<br />
Run main.py to carry out Step 3, 4 and 5.<br />
