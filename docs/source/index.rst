Welcome to GB Kinetics documentation!
=======================================

GB Kinetics is an open source python library to explore mechanisms for Grain Boundary (GB) migration mediated
by nucleation and glide of disconnections. Some key features are:

#. Generation of bicrystals using bicrystallographic data from oILAB.

#. Exploration of energy landscape of GB microstates using :math:`\gamma`-surface method.

#. Creation of atomic configurations for motion of GB due to nucleation and glide of any disconnection mode.

#. Calculation of Minimum energy path (MEP) GB motion using Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method.
